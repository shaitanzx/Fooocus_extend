I would like to introduce a new fork of the popular generative neural network **Fooocus - Fooocus extend**. 
I would like to point out that this fork can be run both locally on your computer and via Google Colab. 
Let's look at everything in order. 

**Launch**. If you will run it on a local machine, you can safely skip this item.
   
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/468487b8-8d4e-454c-ba92-1c9e5b60feb7)

Before launching you are offered to choose the following settings
Fooocus Profile - select which profile will be loaded at startup (default, anime, realistic).
Fooocus Theme - select a theme - light or dark.
Tunnel - select launch tunnel. When it happens that gradio stops working for some reason, you can choose cloudflared tunnel. However, the generation is a bit slower
Memory patch - adds a few keys to the launch bar that allow you to optimise your graphics card if you are using the free version of Google Colab. If you have paid access, this item can be disabled
GoogleDrive output - connects your GoogleDisk and save all of your generation directly to it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323f6311-bbb4-477f-860d-3cfecae5d89b)

The **“Extensions”** panel is divided into three groups:
- in generation - modules working during generation
- modules - generation modules
- tools - auxiliary tools

**“in generation”** panel

**OneButtonPrompt** - allows you to generate prompts, generate variations of your prompt and runs to generate images from them. I will not dwell on the detailed description of this module - I will only point out the main functions

<img width="1176" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/754584c0-a35b-4b67-a4e6-654d2fc3f47a" />

On the "Main" tab, you can select a preset for the hint generation theme, as well as specify additional hint prefixes and suffixes.
You can also create and save your own preset in this tab.

<img width="718" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8f1b30b-6472-4c94-b7b7-00ae6376f669" />

On the "Prompt assist" tab, you can generate 5 prompts and move each of them to the Fooocus prompt field.
When you select the "Prompt assist" mode, during image generation, not a new prompt will be generated, but variations of the prompt specified in the prompt field.
The strength of variation is selected by the slider located directly below it.

<img width="714" height="614" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18102090-988f-4aca-bce6-fa9b3792e984" />

In this tab you can select the hint syntax for different generation models, the hint length, enable the hint generation enhancement tool, and specify the number of iterations of the prompt generation for one image.

<img width="1175" height="363" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb26223-616e-4e21-a78f-8eb6b5083a58" />

This is where you can control the generation of negative prompts

**Prompt Translate**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ddff3b1-5e98-43d4-b102-b61176c40c84)


Allows to translate both positive and negative prompts from any language into English, both before generation and directly during generation.

**PhotoMaker** (works only in the local version)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15a668a-53aa-4607-a7ed-7d277a3726de)

The module allows you to generate an image with a reference face
Upload a photo of your face - your reference face should be uploaded here.
**Unlike normal generation, this 30-step generation on Nvidia 3060 12GB takes about 4 minutes.**


**InstantID** (works only in the local version) 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f12b7389-48b4-4659-a94d-5d01268ab179)

The module allows you to generate an image with a reference face
Upload a photo of your face - your reference face should be uploaded here.

Upload a reference pose image (Optional) - a reference pose image will be uploaded here. Optional.

Pregeneration image - if this mode is enabled, then a new image will be generated as a reference pose image based on your Prompt.

If you have not specified a pose reference image, an image will be generated from your prompt based only on the face image and the same resolution. 

If a pose reference image is present, the dimensions will be the same as the pose reference image.

IdentityNet strength (for fidelity) - responsible for the accuracy of face repetition.

Image adapter strength (for detail) - responsible for details

ContrloNet
- canny - used to define image contours
- depth - used to create a depth map of the image
Schedulers - select the Schedulers that will be used when generating the image with our face.
Enhance non-face region - enhance non-face parts of the image

**Unlike normal generation, this 30-step generation on Nvidia 3060 12GB takes about 7 minutes.**

**Inswapper**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3399327d-0fe4-46cc-8f34-430e94ab7910)

This module is also intended for face replacement.

Source Image Index - index of the face in the reference image. Faces are numbered from left to right from top to bottom starting from zero. If you specify -1, the average mixed face of all available faces will be taken as the reference face

Target Image Index - index of the face in the output image. This is the index of the face to be replaced in the output image. If you specify -1, all faces will be replaced.

Source Face Image - image with face

**CodeFormer**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/512eb538-1923-439d-ad2a-826d7594e49e)

Face enhancement module with upscale capability

Pre_Face_Align - aligns the face if it is tilted

Background Enchanced - improve background quality

**“modules”** panel

**Image Batch** (batch image processing)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5279f1f1-ab59-4182-be78-b28e9b6c1043)

In a nutshell, this module allows you to perform group scaling of images, as well as create images based on a group of existing images using ImagePromt (ControlNet). To better understand this module, I suggest you conduct some experiments yourself. But I want to note that using it allows you to use your images as references and change their style depending on the prompt and model you choose. First, depending on the "Uplode ZIP-file" selector, you need to upload several reference images or a zip archive with them. The archive should not contain subfolders, file names should not contain non-Latin characters and spaces.

 Next, select the mode of changing the image resolution
- NOT scale - the source image resolution will not be taken into account during generation
- to ORIGINAL - this means that immediately before generation the resolution equal to the resolution of the source image will be selected.
- to OUTPUT - in this case, before generation the resolution of the source image will be changed to the generated one with preserving the proportions
  
Depending on what you want to do with the source images, select Action - Upscale or ImagePrompt. From the Method drop-down list, select the appropriate image processing method. If you are using ImagePrompt, you must also select the "Stop at" and "Weight" options.

Start batch - starts the process for execution. 

When the process is finished, click on Output->Zip button to create an archive with all previously created images from the output folder. The archive itself will appear in the "Download a Zip file" window. You can download it from there.

Clear Output - clear the output folder. It should be noted that not only the folder for the current date is cleared, but also the whole folder.


**Prompt Batch** (batch processing of prompts)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06ae0644-4e4b-4456-a92b-7699606d9ce0)

This module allows you to run generation of several hints sequentially one after another. To do this, you should fill in the table. Enter a positive hint in the hint column and a negative hint in the negative hint column respectively. Clicking the New Row button will add an empty row to the end of the table. Delete Last Row deletes the last row of the table. Start batch starts the execution of the list of prompts to generate.
You can also choose to add basic positive and negative hints.
None - no base hints will be added.
Prefix - base hints will be added before the table hints.
Suffix - basic hints will be added after hints from the table.

only positive prompts - if this item is active, all prompts in the file will be considered positive, otherwise, both positive and negative prompts will be loaded
Load prompts from file - allows to load the list of positive and negative prompts from a text file into the table. The file can have any extension

As an example, consider a file with the following contents

---- start of file -------

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/750dff48-0bcc-4a20-b754-2d40f443e938)

------ end of file --------

If the item ‘only positive prompts’ is active, then the table with prompts will have the following form


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5df613e-d5c4-4088-abad-bf727f84f041)


Otherwise

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f005878-cadc-443f-a76f-7f20dda088b2)

This means that in the first case all prompts in the file are treated as positive, and empty lines are ignored.
In the second case, the file first contains a line with a positive prompt, followed by a line with a negative prompt. If you don't need to specify a negative hint, leave this line blank, but the positive hint line must always be there.


**X/Y/Z Plot**

![019](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0392f94-8ef0-4377-a2d6-9d260ba4a20c)


This extension allows you to make image grids to make it easier to see the difference between different generation settings and choose the best option. You can change the following parameters - Styles, Steps, Aspect Ratio, Seed, Sharpness, CFG (Guidance) Scale, Checkpoint, Refiner, Clip skip, Sampler, Scheduler, VAE, Refiner swap method, Softness of ControlNet, and also replace words in the prompt and change their order
